After running my application, it asks for the type of conversation you want to. You need to type ‘miles’ for converting from kilometers to miles, ‘km’ for converting miles to kilometers. Then after choosing one, it asks for the distance to convert and makes the conversion. My application also calculates cost of fuel per km and per mile using a switch case and with predefined unit price.
